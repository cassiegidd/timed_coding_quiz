# timed_coding_quiz

## Description

This webpage is a dynamic quiz to test the user on thier knowledge of some basic java script concenpts. The user can save their score and subsequent scores. All scores will be saved in their local storage and displayed on the quiz (top left) for them to access and compare.

## Usage
The user will press "start" and the quiz will begin by displaying the first multiple choice question and starting a timer that counts down from sixty. If the user gets a question correct, the next quextion will be displayed, but if the user gets a question wrong, the timer will subtract three seconds from the timer before moving on to the next question. Once the user has answered all questions, the timer will stop and the time left will be the score. The user will be prompted to log their intials and once submitted, the users initials and score will be displayed in the "scores" tab. The user can access those scores to compare and measure their progress.
